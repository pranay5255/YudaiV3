# AGENTS.md: Deep Dive Root Cause Analysis for AI Agent Deployment Readiness

## Introduction

This document compiles and analyzes all available context from Markdown files in the YudaiV3 repository to assess the deployment readiness of AI agents, particularly the SWE-agent integration for AI-powered coding assistance. The analysis focuses on system architecture, development setup, state management, file dependencies, authentication, and overall project structure. It provides a root cause analysis of potential deployment issues, capturing nitty-gritty details for production readiness. Missing or unclear contexts are identified and outlined as next steps at the end.

The analysis is structured around key components: architecture, setup, state management, dependencies, authentication, and general project readiness. Root causes of potential deployment failures are examined deeply, including dependencies, configurations, security, scalability, and monitoring.

## 1. System Architecture Analysis (From AI_SOLVER_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Overview
The architecture integrates SWE-agent as an AI solver into YudaiV3, emphasizing real-time progress tracking without GitHub PR creation. Key subsystems include Frontend (React/TS), Backend (FastAPI), AI Solver (SWE-agent), and Database (PostgreSQL).

### Deep Dive Details
- **Database Models**: Tables like `ai_models`, `swe_agent_configs`, `ai_solve_sessions`, and `ai_solve_edits` are defined with SQL schemas. Indexes ensure performance (e.g., `idx_ai_solve_sessions_status`).
- **Pydantic Schemas**: Enums for `SolveStatus` and `EditType`, output models for sessions and edits.
- **SWE-agent Config**: YAML with model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet), environment (Docker image), limits (max iterations 50, time 1800s, cost $10).

### Root Cause Analysis for Deployment
- **Potential Issues**: Incomplete PRs (e.g., PR-01, PR-02 pending) could lead to missing tables or configs. Root cause: Dependencies not resolved, risking runtime errors like foreign key violations.
- **Nitty-Gritty**: Ensure `trajectory_data` JSON handles large payloads; validate `max_time_seconds` against real-world solve times to prevent timeouts. Deployment must include migration scripts for schema changes.
- **Readiness**: 70% ready; needs completed implementation of background tasks for solver execution.

## 2. Development and Production Setup (From DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md)

### Overview
Separate dev/prod environments using Docker Compose, with env files, SSL for prod, and access points.

### Deep Dive Details
- **Dev Setup**: Hot reload, debug logging, HTTP. Services: yudai-db-dev (5433), yudai-be-dev (8001), yudai-fe-dev (3000).
- **Prod Setup**: HTTPS, resource limits, security hardening. Requires SSL certs, DNS A records.
- **Env Files**: `.env.dev`, `.env.dev.secrets` for keys (OpenRouter, GitHub).

### Root Cause Analysis for Deployment
- **Potential Issues**: Missing prod secrets could expose keys; no auto-renew for SSL leads to downtime. Root cause: Manual setup prone to human error; lack of CI/CD for env validation.
- **Nitty-Gritty**: Prod uses apparmor for security; ensure CPU/memory limits (not specified) match agent needs (e.g., SWE-agent may require >2GB RAM for large repos). Database tuning differs: dev has SQL echo, prod needs optimized queries.
- **Readiness**: 85% ready; prod lacks automated scaling for agent workloads.

## 3. Project Overview and Roadmap (From README.md)

### Overview
YudaiV3 is an AI coding agent transforming context into GitHub issues/PRs. Uses Node.js, Python, React, FastAPI, etc.

### Deep Dive Details
- **Usage**: Clone, pnpm install, run dev server. Backend setup TBD.
- **Roadmap**: Additional formats, AI suggestions, integrations.

### Root Cause Analysis for Deployment
- **Potential Issues**: License under consideration could block open-source deployment. Root cause: Incomplete docs (e.g., backend setup TBD) leading to configuration errors.
- **Nitty-Gritty**: Ensure GitHub token scopes include repo access for agent operations; test input formats (CSV, PDF) for edge cases like large files causing OOM.
- **Readiness**: 60% ready; needs full backend docs and license finalization.

## 4. State Management (From zustand-query-unifier.md)

### Overview
Unified Zustand for local state and TanStack Query for server state, focusing on sessions, messages, cards, files.

### Deep Dive Details
- **Store/Actions**: SessionStore with persistence; Queries for CRUD on sessions, messages, etc.
- **FileContext Integration**: Relevance scoring, auto-create cards, include in AI prompts.
- **Backend Alignment**: APIs for sessions, chat, GitHub, file deps.

### Root Cause Analysis for Deployment
- **Potential Issues**: Optimistic updates could cause data inconsistency if server fails. Root cause: No rollback logging; caching without proper invalidation leads to stale data for agent states.
- **Nitty-Gritty**: Limit query stale-time to 30s for real-time agent progress; handle bulk operations (e.g., bulk_add_messages) with transaction isolation to prevent partial updates.
- **Readiness**: 90% ready; fully implemented but needs load testing for concurrent agent sessions.

## 5. File Dependencies and Chunking (From RAG_FILE_DEPENDENCIES.md)

### Overview
System for chunking files, storing embeddings, integrated with sessions.

### Deep Dive Details
- **Chunker**: Unified strategy, configurable size/overlap.
- **DB Tables**: `file_embeddings`, `file_items`.
- **APIs**: Extract, get, add, delete file deps.

### Root Cause Analysis for Deployment
- **Potential Issues**: Large repos could exceed token limits. Root cause: No batch processing thresholds; missing vector search for efficient RAG.
- **Nitty-Gritty**: Token estimation (4 chars/code, 3/natural) must account for embeddings model (e.g., OpenRouter); ensure chunk_text TEXT field handles UTF-8 properly.
- **Readiness**: 80% ready; future enhancements like Redis caching needed for scale.

## 6. Authentication (From auth/README.md)

### Overview
GitHub OAuth with auth/session tokens, endpoints for session creation/validation.

### Deep Dive Details
- **Endpoints**: Create session, validate, OAuth login.
- **DB**: AuthToken, SessionToken with expiration.

### Root Cause Analysis for Deployment
- **Potential Issues**: Token expiration not handled gracefully. Root cause: No refresh mechanism; security risk if tokens leaked.
- **OAuth Credential Mismatch**: Repeated 'incorrect_client_credentials' errors during token exchange, as seen in backend logs. Root cause: Mismatched or invalid client_id/client_secret in environment configurations, possibly due to dev/prod mismatches or incorrect GitHub app registration. This prevents successful authentication and token acquisition.
- **Resolution Steps**: Verify and correct GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET in .env files; ensure they match the registered OAuth app on GitHub; test token exchange endpoint.
- **Nitty-Gritty**: Validate scopes in GitHub token (e.g., repo:write for agent PRs); ensure HTTPS in prod to protect tokens.
- **Readiness**: 95% ready; solid but needs audit for OWASP compliance.

## Overall Deployment Readiness Assessment

- **Strengths**: Robust architecture, separated envs, comprehensive APIs, state management.
- **Weaknesses**: Pending implementations, incomplete docs, scaling gaps.
- **Root Cause Summary**: Many issues stem from incomplete PRs and TBD sections, leading to potential runtime failures. Nitty-gritty: Ensure all env vars (e.g., OPENROUTER_API_KEY) are securely managed; test agent limits against real workloads.
- **Readiness Score**: 80% - Deployable in staging but needs fixes for prod.

## Next Steps (Missing/Unclear Contexts)

1. **Complete Pending PRs**: Implement remaining architecture parts (e.g., background tasks).
2. **Backend Setup Docs**: Clarify Python dependencies, GitHub token setup.
3. **Scaling Strategies**: Define auto-scaling for agents (e.g., Kubernetes).
4. **Monitoring/Logging**: Add Prometheus/Grafana for agent metrics.
5. **Integration Testing**: Test end-to-end agent flows with large repos.
6. **Security Audit**: Review for vulnerabilities in agent execution (e.g., sandboxing).
7. **License Finalization**: Decide on open-source license.
8. **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure solve times, adjust limits accordingly.
