# Add a Simple Button to the React UI

## Problem Description
The user wants to add a basic button to the React-based user interface in the project. This is a common UI enhancement request to enable user interactions, such as logging a click event.

## Context from Conversation
In the chat session, the user asked: "How do I add a simple button to UI in React?" The response provided a basic example of implementing a button component in React, including an event handler for clicks. This issue captures that intent to integrate such a feature into the `tfbdmap3` repository, which appears to be a React application (based on the file analysis of 25 files, likely including React components).

No specific component or location in the codebase was mentioned, so this should be added to a relevant UI section, such as a main dashboard or map interface (inferred from the repo name `tfbdmap3`, possibly related to mapping).

## Relevant Files and Code Sections
- The project uses React (inferred from the query and repo structure with ~25 files, estimated 75.6k tokens).
- Potential files to modify: Look for existing React components (e.g., `App.js`, `Dashboard.js`, or similar entry points in `src/components/`).
- No exact file paths provided in the conversation, but integrate into an existing functional component.

## Implementation Suggestions
Use the provided example code as a starting point. Create or update a component to include a button with an `onClick` handler that logs a message to the console (or triggers a relevant action in the app, like toggling a map feature).

Here's the suggested code snippet to incorporate:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Click Me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

- Import and render this in the parent component (e.g., `App.js`).
- Style the button if needed using existing CSS or inline styles for consistency with the project's UI.
- Ensure it fits the app's theme, perhaps labeling it something context-specific like "Toggle Map View" if relevant to `tfbdmap3`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A button element is added to at least one React component in the UI.
- [ ] The button includes an `onClick` event handler that logs a message to the console (or performs a simple action).
- [ ] The button renders correctly without errors in the browser.
- [ ] Code is integrated into the existing codebase (e.g., via a new or updated component file).
- [ ] Basic testing: Button click triggers the handler (verifiable via browser console).
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality.

This enhancement is marked as medium priority and should improve user interactivity in the React app.
