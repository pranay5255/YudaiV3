YudaiV3 is an **AI-powered coding agent** that connects to your GitHub repository to transform raw context‚Äîsuch as chat summaries, CSVs, PDFs, or plain text‚Äîinto concise, actionable GitHub issues and pull requests. By leveraging file-dependency insights and analytics, YudaiV3 simplifies the development lifecycle, making it easier for teams to bridge the gap between ideas and implementation.

## üéØ Who is YudaiV3 for?

YudaiV3 streamlines development workflows for a wide range of users:

- **Software Developers**: Generate feature scaffolds or bug fixes from high-level descriptions, reducing manual setup time.
- **Product Managers & Designers**: Convert user stories, mockups, or customer feedback into developer-ready GitHub issues without technical expertise.
- **Technical Teams**: Standardize and automate the creation of high-quality, bite-sized pull requests to improve collaboration and project management.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Context-Rich Issue Generation**: Turns unstructured data (CSVs, notes, PDFs) into detailed, actionable GitHub issues.
- **Three-Agent Architecture**: A specialized pipeline of PM, Architect, and Coder agents ensures a seamless flow from raw data to test-driven code.
- **Automated Workflow**: From data analysis to PR creation, Yudai automates the tedious parts of project management and development.
- **Local & Cloud Ready**: Run it on your own infrastructure for privacy or use our cloud version for convenience.
