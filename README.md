## What is YudaiV3?

YudaiV3 is a **model marketplace for coding agents**. It transforms your repo‚Äôs development activity (issues created, PRs merged) into a finetuned, tokenized model that you can **list, provide liquidity for, and monetize**.

- **Base Models:** GPT-5, Claude, Qwen3-Coder, Grok (and more)
- **Milestone ‚Üí Finetune:** After **30 issues created** and **30 issues merged**, you can trigger a guided finetune
- **Tokenization:** Each finetuned model mints its own **ERC-20 (AGENTx)**, paired with **$SOLVE** on Uniswap v4
- **Monetization:** Earn from **per-request usage** (x402 pay-per-call) and **LP swap fees** streamed via Uniswap v4 **Hooks**

---

## Who is it for?

- **Solo devs & indie hackers** who want their repo history to compound into a sellable model
- **Product & growth engineers** who want usage-based revenue on top of existing workflows
- **Open-source maintainers** who seek a sustainable economic loop tied to real code impact

---

## How it works (high-level)

1. **Create & Merge**  
   Keep shipping. YudaiV3 tracks issues created and merged PRs to build your training corpus.

2. **Hit 30/30 ‚Üí Finetune**  
   Reach **30 issues created** and **30 merged** to unlock a guided finetune for your repo-specific agent.

3. **Mint & List (AGENTx)**  
   Your model is minted as **AGENTx (ERC-20)** and listed **AGENTx / $SOLVE** on Uniswap v4.

4. **Provide Liquidity & Earn**  
   Add LP to deepen markets. **Uniswap v4 Hooks** stream a portion of swap fees to your creator vault.

5. **Get Paid Per Request (x402)**  
   The hosted model charges per request using **x402 (HTTP-402)**. Usage revenue settles in stable assets and is routed to your vault, with internal conversion to support your token.

> **All of the above happens without changing your GitHub workflow.** You build; the marketplace handles tokenization, liquidity, and billing.

---

## Key Concepts

- **$SOLVE**  
  Ecosystem and routing token used to pair liquidity with model tokens and anchor discovery across pools.

- **AGENTx (per-model ERC-20)**  
  A token representing your finetuned model. Traders can provide LP; users can pay to call your model; you earn from both.

- **Uniswap v4 Hooks**  
  Pool-level logic that automatically **directs a share of trading fees** to creator/protocol vaults‚Äîno manual harvesting.

- **x402 Pay-Per-Call**  
  Machine-native HTTP-402 billing for **per-request** or **per-token** usage. Clean receipts, stable settlement, creator-first routing.
